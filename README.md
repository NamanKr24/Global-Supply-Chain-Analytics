# Global Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

Unlock actionable insights hidden within complex supply chain data with this end-to-end Power BI dashboard project.

## üìå Project Overview

Modern supply chains generate massive volumes of data but fail to convert them into impactful decisions. This project bridges that gap by building a dynamic, executive-level dashboard analysing sales, product performance, delivery metrics, and order management across global markets.

## üí° Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to monitor end-to-end supply chain performance efficiently. Key challenges include:

- Lack of consolidated visibility into sales, profit, and logistics performance  
- Inability to pinpoint high-risk SKUs, delayed deliveries, or low-performing markets  
- Difficulty in executive-level reporting with interactive and intuitive visuals

This dashboard addresses these by providing targeted insights and streamlined visual storytelling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**: Data cleaning, modelling, DAX measures, and visual design  
- **Excel**: Raw dataset source (DataCo Supply Chain dataset)  
- **DAX**: Custom measures for KPIs and advanced visuals

## üìä Dashboard Structure

The dashboard comprises **four pages**, each with a specific analytical objective:

### 1. Executive Summary

_Key Focus_: Overall sales, profit, order quantity, and high-level supply chain KPIs.
